# Power BI Dashboard for Stack Overflow 2022 Survey
This repository contains a Power BI dashboard created using the Stack Overflow 2022 survey data. The dashboard provides insights into the survey responses, focusing on demographics, popular programming languages, and common roles and degrees.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this dashboard is the Stack Overflow 2022 survey, which can be accessed [here](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey). Some columns have been removed from the original dataset to enhance convenience and relevance. Additionally, certain transformations and calculations have been applied to ensure appropriate calculations and optimal visualization.

## Dashboard Pages
The Power BI dashboard consists of three pages:

1. Demographics
This page includes information related to the demographic characteristics of survey respondents. It provides insights into age, gender, salary, and other relevant factors. The visuals highlight trends and patterns within these demographic variables, helping to understand the composition of the surveyed population.

2. Popular Languages (Worked with and To Be Learned Next Year)
On this page, you will find a drill-down analysis of the most popular programming languages. The visuals showcase both the languages that respondents have worked with in the past and the ones they plan to learn in the coming year. This information can be helpful in determining the current and future technology trends and preferences among developers.

3. Common Roles, Degrees, etc.
The third page focuses on common roles, degrees, and other related factors within the developer community. It highlights the distribution of various roles, educational backgrounds, and additional information to provide insights into job titles, qualifications, and skillsets prevalent in the industry.

## Data Transformations and Calculations
To ensure accurate analysis and effective visualization, certain transformations and calculations have been performed on the dataset. These include:

Type conversions: Some columns were transformed to appropriate data types to enable correct calculations and analysis.

Calculated measures: Additional measures such as average age and salary have been calculated to provide more contextual information.

Data filtering: Certain data points may have been removed from the visuals to focus on relevant information and avoid overwhelming the dashboard with excessive data.
